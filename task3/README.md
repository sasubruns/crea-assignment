# Task 3: Data Processing

This folder contains the solution for Task 3. Simply run `process.py` to process the data, then run `chart.py` to display it in time series form. I also saved the chart as `chart.png` in case you're feeling lazy.

Consumption is calculated as `net_imports + production`. I made the assumption that net imports can be calculated as `gross_imports - gross_exports`.
