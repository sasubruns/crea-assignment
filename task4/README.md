# Task 4: Data visualization

This folder contains the solution for Task 4. Run `chart.py` to build stacked time series area plots for all commodities. Categorical grouping and numerical variable can be changed at the start of the file by changing which lines are commented. I have included three example charts in this folder.

### Thoughts

The way I chose to visualize this data was just one of many. The data was very multi-dimensional and thus could be used for many purposes. I chose to enable using either the source country or the destination region as the categorical variable for charting, however it would be interesting to come up with ways to also include destination country information without the visualization getting clogged. Perhaps only showing the largest importer countries would work well.
