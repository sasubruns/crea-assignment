# crea-assignment
Solutions for the technical assignment can be found in this repository. Each task is in a separate folder, and each of those folders contains it's own readme file which contain instructions for running code. The solutions to Task 1 are found in `task1/README.md` as well.

### Requirements

The code in this repository was run using python version 3.8.10. I imagine later versions will work too. I have included the output of `pip3 freeze` in the file `freeze.txt`. If you get errors with missing libraries, you can look in there to find the right version to install.
