# crea-assignment
Solutions for the technical assignment can be found in this repository. Each task is in a separate folder, and each of those folders contains it's own README.md which contain instructions for running code. The solutions to Task 1 are found in `task1/README.md` as well.

The code in this repository was run using python version 3.8.10. I imagine later versions will work too.
